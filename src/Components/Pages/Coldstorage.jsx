        <h2>Importance of Cold Storage in the Potato Supply Chain</h2>
        <p>
          Cold storage plays a crucial role in preserving the quality of potatoes post-harvest. By maintaining an optimal temperature and humidity level,
          cold storage facilities help extend the shelf life of potatoes, prevent spoilage, and reduce losses during transportation and storage. This process
          ensures that the potatoes remain fresh, retain their nutritional value, and meet market demands year-round. Cold storage is especially important for
          preserving the texture and flavor of potatoes, preventing sprouting and dehydration.
