      <h2>Understanding the Immune Response</h2>
      <p>
        Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend your body against harmful invaders. From recognizing pathogens to triggering a response, every step is crucial in keeping you healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process involves various types of immune cells, including white blood cells that act as your body's personal army, attacking and eliminating threats.

    <h2>Why Potatoes Are Important for Your Immune System</h2>
    <p>
      Potatoes are not just a staple food in many diets; they are also a nutritional powerhouse that plays a significant role in supporting the immune system. Rich in essential vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C, potatoes help bolster the body's defenses against infections. This versatile vegetable provides antioxidants that combat free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which can weaken immune function. Additionally, potatoes are an excellent source of dietary fiber, which promotes gut health—a crucial factor for a robust immune response. By delivering complex carbohydrates, they offer sustained energy necessary for the body to fend off illnesses effectively. Incorporating potatoes into a balanced diet not only adds flavor but also contributes to overall health, making them an invaluable ally in maintaining a strong immune system.
