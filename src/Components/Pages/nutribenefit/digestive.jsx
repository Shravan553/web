    <p class="digestive-info">
      Potatoes are packed with essential nutrients and dietary fiber that support a healthy digestive system. 
      The fiber helps regulate bowel movements, prevent constipation, and improve gut health. 
      Additionally, the resistant starch found in potatoes acts as a prebiotic, feeding good bacteria in the gut and promoting a balanced microbiome, 
      which is crucial for efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.
